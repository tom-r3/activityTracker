activityTracker
A new type of activity tracker, designed to be used in conjunction with a keychain device powered by arduino (not yet implemented).

Users add buttons via the settings page for each activity that they do in a day, such that the categories cover the whole day's activities (eg. sleep, travel, gym, schoolwork, cooking/eating, leisure). They can also set buttons that simply "check off" a task, as opposed to an ongoing activity (useful for things one does every day and wants to track, such as "stretch" or "drink water").

The home screen of the app is just these buttons, and the user simply presses the button of the activity they are beginning. The previous activity is automatically ended and stored (users are able to edit these via the settings page), unless the button is a "check task" button. In place of opening the app, users will be able to simply press a button on a keychain (this will be built using arduino and likely have 6 multicoloured buttons). It is currently undecided whether this will work via bluetooth, wifi or usb memory.

Users can then view how they spent their days/weeks in an easy to read graph format so that they can use that information to plan their day better and be more productive. It will offer different views such as a dashboard, total time at a specific activity, past week, past month etc.

This is currently a work in progress.
